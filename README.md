# Olympics History - Data Analysis Case Study

This project's goal was to practice SQL queries while working with real-world dataset and questions. I kept track of the steps I took in the data analysis process, from cleaning, to loading, querying and analysing, and they can be seen in the files below.

**About the dataset**

Available in [Kaggle]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)), the tables used are the following:
- ****athlete_events.csv****, containing data on the modern Olympic Games including all Summer and Winter Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016 and columns such as name, sex, age, weight, height, team, noc, games, year, etc;
- ****noc_regions.csv****, containing three columns: noc (National Olympic Committee 3 letter code), country name and notes.

**About the files**

The files include codes used in MySQL and txt describing the process.

The questions were taken from [this website](https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset), and I changed the last two to talk about the country I grew up in, Brazil. I decided to separate each question into its own SQL file in order to focus on the visualization of the code, making it cleaner and more readable.

Finally, the visualization was done using Power BI desktop. However, as I have no corporate account and cannot publish the work I have done, I decided to make the file downloadable as well.
